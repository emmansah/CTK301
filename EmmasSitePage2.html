					<p>In high school, I treated art as my top priority.
					I took drawing and painting classes, I was in almost every band offered, and I was involved in the theater crew.
					I always knew I would end up studying something in the arts, but I originally applied to ISU as Undecided.
						I wasn't sure about what to major in, but by March 2020 I decided on Creative Tech.
						Taking the time to remain undecided allowed me to complete my Gen Eds.
				  	Unfortunately, I only recently started taking classes for my major, so I don't have a lot of newer work.

					<p> My current future goal is to work on movies.
						I love watching the credits at the end of a movie and seeing so many jobs I've never heard of before.
						This goal is what ultimately led me to decide on Creative Technology as a major.
						I valued the flexibility it offered to create an educational experience that can be catered to each individual's goals.
